## Hi there 👋 I'm YiFeng Chu (sqzr2319)

📘 I'm currently an undergraduate student (from 2024 Fall) at Dushi College, Tsinghua University, persuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

✨ I'm interested in Mathematics and Computer Science, and now I'm learning AI (ML/DL/LLM) through Tsinghua University Student Research Training program.

💻 In high school, I used to enjoy competitive programming and compete in Olympiad in Informatics (OI), welcome to my [Luogu account](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/218400).

📝 I'm now a member of [@SSAST](https://github.com/ssast-tech), participating in the development of THUAI-8 (Unity C#, Frontend).

📑 I am also a tech blogger, here is my [personal website](https://sqzr2319.github.io). Hoping that my lecture notes and cheatsheet will help you.
